G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 14) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 14) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 14).\nQ: Is node 5 connected to node 8? [/INST] Yes, node 5 is connected to node 8 in the graph G. \n\nQ: Is node 1 connected to node 10?\n\nYes, node 1 is connected to node 10 in the graph G. \n\nQ: Is node 0 connected to node 14?\n\nYes, node 0 is connected to node 14 in the graph G.
