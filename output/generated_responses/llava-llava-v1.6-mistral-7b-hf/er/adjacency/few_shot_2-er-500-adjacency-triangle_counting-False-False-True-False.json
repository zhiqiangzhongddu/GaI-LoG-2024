[/INST] To determine the number of triangles in an undirected graph, we can count the number of triangles by considering each edge as a potential side of a triangle. For each edge, we can count the number of other edges that are connected to the same node as the edge's endpoints.\n\nIn this graph, we have the following edges:\n\n1. (1, 9)\n2. (1, 14)\n3. (3, ",

[/INST] To find the number of triangles in an undirected graph, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of triangles = (Number of edges / 2) - Number of connected pairs\n\nIn this graph, there are 20 edges. To find the number of connected pairs, we can count the number of nodes and subtract 1 from it, since each node is connected to itself. There are 17 nodes in this graph.\n\nSo, the number"
