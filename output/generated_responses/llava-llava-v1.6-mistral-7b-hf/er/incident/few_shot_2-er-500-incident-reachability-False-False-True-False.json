  "499": "[INST]  \nG describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\nIn this graph:\nNode 3 is connected to node 7.\nNode 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6.\nNode 5 is connected to node 4.\nNode 6 is connected to node 4.\nNode 7 is connected to node 3.\nQ: Is there a path from node 4 to node 6? [/INST] Yes, there is a path from node 4 to node 6 in the graph. The path is as follows:\n\n1. Start at node 4.\n2. Move to node 5, which is connected to node 4.\n3. Move to node 6, which is connected to node 4.\n\nTherefore, the path from node 4 to node 6 is node 4 -> node 5 -> node 6. "
