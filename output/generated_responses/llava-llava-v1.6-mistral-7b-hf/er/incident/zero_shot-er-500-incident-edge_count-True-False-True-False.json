Answer the question using this format: The number of edges in the graph is []. [/INST] To determine the number of edges in the graph, we need to count the connections between the nodes. In the image, we can see that each node is connected to at least one other node. Since there are seven nodes in total, and each node has at least one connection, we can conclude that there are a minimum of 7 edges in the graph. However, since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted only once, regardless of the direction of the connection. Therefore, the",
