Answer the question using this format: The number of edges in the graph is []. [/INST] The number of edges in the graph is 12. \n\nTo find the number of edges in the graph, we can count the number of connections between each pair of nodes. In this case, we have 9 nodes, and each node is connected to at least one other node. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of edges by multiplying the number of nodes by",
