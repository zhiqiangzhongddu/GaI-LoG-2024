Initialize all nodes as not visited.\n2. For each unvisited node, perform DFS:\n   - Mark the node as visited.\n   - Recur for all the adjacent nodes.\n   - If an adjacent node is visited and it's not the parent of the current node, then there's a cycle.\n\n### Execution:\n\nLet's start with this step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Start with node 0:\n   - Visit 0 -> 8.\n\n2. From node 8:\n   - Adjacent nodes: 0 (already visited) but it's the parent, so continue.\n   - Visit 2. \n\n3.

Given the connections listed for the graph G, we can analyze it as follows:\n\n1. The graph is undirected and has 17 nodes.\n2. Each of the nodes is heavily connected to many other nodes, indicating a high density of edges.\n\nIn graph theory, a cycle occurs if there is a closed loop, meaning that you can start at one node and return to it by traversing distinct edges. Since our graph is highly connected, let's try to identify cycles.\n\nConsider a few basic properties:\n- A simple graph with more edges than nodes, specifically with more than \\( V - 1 \\) edges for \\( V \\) vertices, indicates a highly probable cycle.\n- The given graph has far more than 16 edges (the number of edges exceeds the minimum requirement to potentially form a cycle).\n\nUpon careful analysis, by examining nodes and their connections, we can conclude that:\n\n- Starting from node 0, it connects to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, etc.\n- Node 1 connects back to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n- Node 2 connects back to nodes 0, 1, 3, etc.\n\nThis level of interconnectivity between these three nodes (0, 1, 2) itself forms a cycle: 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 0.\n\nTherefore, there is definitely a cycle in the graph.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\nYes, there is a cycle in this graph.",
  "479": "Yes, there are cycles in this graph.\n\nTo verify the presence of cycles, we can start from any node and perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). If we encounter a previously visited node that is not the parent of the current node during the traversal, it indicates the existence of a cycle.\n\nGiven the complexity of the graph and the numerous edges, we can quickly identify cycles. For example:\n\n- Consider the path: 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 0. This forms a cycle because you return to the starting node 0.\n- Another example path: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 2. This also forms a cycle.\n\nGiven these examples and the interconnected nature of the nodes, the graph contains multiple cycles. Thus, the graph G definitely has cycles.",
