A triangle is formed by choosing any 3 nodes from the set of 17 nodes and ensuring all the selected nodes are connected to each other. Given the high number of connections, we can infer that the graph is highly connected.\n\nWe can first count the total possible triangles in a fully connected graph (or complete graph, \\(K_{17}\\)). A \\(K_{17}\\) graph has:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{17}{3} = \\frac{17!}{3!(17-3)!} = \\frac{17 \\times 16 \\times 15}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 680\n\\]\n\nSince this graph is almost fully connected with just a few missing edges, the triangles missing due to any missing edge might be negligible. We can safely assume that the number of triangles in this almost complete graph remains very close to 680.\n\nThus, the number of triangles in the graph is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{680}\n\\]",
