Begin by counting the edges connected to each vertex, moving from one vertex to the next:\n   - Vertex 0 connects to: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 (15 edges).\n   - Vertex 1 connects to: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 (15 edges from vertex 1, but 0-1 is already counted, so 14 additional edges).\n   - This pattern is continued for each vertex, subtracting already counted edges.\n\n2. Because each edge is counted twice when considering individual vertices, sum the counts for the vertices and divide by two.\n\nInstead of counting manually, it's often more practical to approximate or use graph-theoretical properties, if applicable. For a graph where every vertex is connected to nearly all others, known as a complete or near-complete graph, the formula for a complete graph (K_n):\n\\[ \\text{Number of Edges} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\]\nWe can estimate if the graph is close to complete for less manual effort.\n\nHere, the graph appears complex but not perfectly complete. Vertices 0 to 15 means \\( n = 16 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{16(16-1)}{2} = \\frac{16 \\times 15}{2} = 120 \\text{ edges in a complete graph}\\]\n\nThis is close but slightly more to account for visibly missing edges.
