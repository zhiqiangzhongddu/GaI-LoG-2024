This is often computationally challenging due to the number of possible combinations, especially in a dense graph like this.\n\nGiven that this graph is very close to a complete graph (a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge):\n\n1. All nodes (except node 0, which is missing some edges) have a very high degree of connectivity.\n2. The number of triangles in a complete graph of \\(n\\) nodes can be calculated by \\( \\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \\).\n\nHowever, node 0 is not connected to nodes 2, 7, and 14. This means that any triangle involving these nodes will not include node 0. We need to account for the missing connections from node 0.\n\nNodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, making a total of \\( n = 15 \\) vertices.\n\n1. Calculate the number of triangles in a complete graph of 15 nodes:\n\\[ \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{6} = 455 \\]\n\n2. Node 0 is missing 3 connections (to nodes 2, 7, and 14). Subtract the 3 triangles involving each pair of those 3 nodes with node 0.\n\n3. The missing combinations are:\n   - (0, 2, 7)\n   - (0, 2, 14)\n   - (0, 7, 14)\n\nEach of these 3 combinations represents 1 triangle that does not exist due to node 0's missing edges.\n\n4. Subtract the missing triangles from the total in a complete graph:\n\\[ 455 - 3 = 452 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [452].",
