  "497": "To find the length of the shortest path from node 13 to node 9 in the given undirected graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, let's construct the graph G using the provided edges:\n- Nodes: 0 to 17\n- Edges: (1, 17), (2, 10), (3, 11), (3, 16), (6, 16)\n\nHere is the adjacency list representation of the graph G:\n```\n0: []\n1: [17]\n2: [10]\n3: [11, 16]\n6: [16]\n10: [2]\n11: [3]\n16: [3, 6]\n17: [1]\n```\nNow we perform a BFS starting from node 13 to find the shortest path to node 9:\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (13) with a distance of 0.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\nStep-by-step BFS process:\n1. Start with the queue: `[(13, 0)]` (node, distance)\n2. Dequeue (13, 0): Since node 13 is not connected to any other nodes, the queue becomes empty.\n\nSince there are no connections from node 13 to any other nodes in the graph, it's impossible to reach node 9 from node 13.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from node 13 to node 9 is infinite or undefined in this graph.\n\nThe length of the shortest path is [] (undefined).",
  "498": "To find the shortest path from node 10 to node 5, we can look at the connected edges step by step:\n\nInspecting the edges list:\n- Node 10 is directly connected to nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13.\n- Node 5 is directly connected to nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.\n\nFrom the list, we see that node 5 and node 10 have a direct connection between them (edge (5, 10)).\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is [1].",
  "499": "Given the graph and the edges (7, 15) and (10, 11), we note that nodes 14 and 3 are not connected to any other nodes. Therefore, it's impossible to find a path between node 14 and node 3.\n\nThe length of the shortest path is [undefined]."
