The formula to calculate the number of triangles in a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of nodes.\n\n3. For \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n\\]\n\n4. Calculating the factorials:\n\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n\\]\n\\[\n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\n5. Plugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{5040}{6 \\times 24} = \\frac{5040}{144} = 35\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of triangles in the graph is [35].",
