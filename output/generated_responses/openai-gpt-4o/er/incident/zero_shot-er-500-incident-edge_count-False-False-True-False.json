To avoid counting duplicate edges in an undirected graph, we notice that if one node connects to another, the connection is bidirectional.\n\nEach node is connected to 14 other nodes (excluding itself). So initially, we might think there are \\( n \\times 14 \\) (where \\( n \\) is the number of nodes) connections:\n\n\\[ 16 \\times 14 = 224 \\]\n\nSince each edge is counted twice (once for each node in the pair), we divide the total by 2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{224}{2} = 112 \\]\n\nThus, the number of edges in the graph is [112].",
