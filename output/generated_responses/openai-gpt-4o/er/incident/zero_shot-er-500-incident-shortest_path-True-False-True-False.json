If `current_node` is not visited, add it to `visited`.\n     4. Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of `current_node` with an incremented distance.\n\nNow, let's perform the BFS:\n\n```\nInitial state:\nqueue = [(9, 0)]\nvisited = {}\n\nIteration 1:\nDequeue: current_node = 9, current_distance = 0\nNeighbors of 9: [5]\nEnqueue: (5, 1)\nqueue = [(5, 1)]\nvisited = {9}\n\nIteration 2:\nDequeue: current_node = 5, current_distance = 1\nNeighbors of 5: [0]\nEnqueue: (0, 2)\nqueue = [(0, 2)]\nvisited = {9, 5}\n\nIteration 3:\nDequeue: current_node = 0, current_distance = 2\n```\n\nAt this point, the `current_node` is 0, which is our target.
