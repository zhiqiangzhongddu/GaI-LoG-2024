Since this information is not provided, I am unable to accurately calculate the shortest path.\n\nIf you can provide the structure of the graph, either visually or textually, I will be able to determine the shortest path.\n\nPlease provide the graph or its description, such as:\n\n- A list of edges connecting specific pairs of nodes.\n- The distances or weights of these edges if applicable.",
  "496": "The length of the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 can be found by examining the direct connection between these nodes in the graph.\n\nFrom the provided description, we know:\n- Node 6 is directly connected to node 4.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 is 1.\n\nThe length of the shortest path is [1].",
  "497": "Based on the provided graph:\n\n- The adjacency list is as follows:\n  - Node 1: [17]\n  - Node 2: [10]\n  - Node 3: [11, 16]\n  - Node 6: [16]\n  - Node 10: [2]\n  - Node 11: [3]\n  - Node 16: [3, 6]\n  - Node 17: [1]\n\nNote that there are no connections involving nodes 9 and 13 explicitly listed.\n\nGiven this information, there is no direct or indirect path connecting node 13 to node 9 or any nodes connected to them. Therefore, the nodes are isolated from each other and no path exists.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 13 to node 9 does not exist.\n\nThe length of the shortest path is [undefined or infinity].",
  "498": "To find the length of the shortest path from node 10 to node 5, we analyze the connections provided in the graph description.\n\nFrom the given information, we know:\n- Node 10 is connected to: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13.\n- Node 5 is directly listed as a neighbor of node 10.\n\nSince node 10 is directly connected to node 5, the length of the shortest path from node 10 to node 5 is just 1 edge.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is [1].",
  "499": "Given the provided graph structure, nodes 14 and 3 are not mentioned in any connections. Assuming these are all the connections in the graph, nodes 14 and 3 are isolated and have no path between them.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shortest path is [undefined] as there is no path connecting node 14 to node 3 in the given graph."
