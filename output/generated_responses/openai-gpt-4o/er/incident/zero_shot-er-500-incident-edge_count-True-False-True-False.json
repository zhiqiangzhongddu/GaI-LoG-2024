Given that every edge is bidirectional and each connection is listed twice (once for each connected node), we'll count each listed connection and then divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\nHere's a detailed count of the connections:\n\n- Node 0: 6 edges (to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12)\n- Node 1: 1 edge (to node 3)\n- Node 2: 3 edges (to nodes 3, 4, 11)\n- Node 3: 6 edges (to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 11)\n- Node 4: 5 edges (to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8)\n- Node 5: 4 edges (to nodes 4, 9, 12, 13)\n- Node 6: 3 edges (to nodes 0, 3, 4)\n- Node 7: 2 edges (to nodes 0, 9)\n- Node 8: 5 edges (to nodes 0, 3, 4, 9, 11)\n- Node 9: 4 edges (to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8)\n- Node 10: 1 edge (to node 0)\n- Node 11: 4 edges (to nodes 2, 3, 8, 12)\n- Node 12: 3 edges (to nodes 0, 5, 11)\n- Node 13: 1 edge (to node 5)\n\nNow, summing these counts:\n6 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 48\n\nSince each edge is counted twice, we divide by 2:\n48 / 2 = 24\n\nThe number of edges in the graph is [24].",
