A triangle in an undirected graph is defined as a set of three nodes such that each pair of nodes in the set is connected by an edge.\n\nGiven that we have the connectivity for each node, we can count all combinations of three nodes that form a triangle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Counting:\n\n1. **Identify all triangles:**\n   - We can count all triangles by iterating through all triples of vertices and checking if they form a triangle.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n#### Manual Calculation:\nWe need to consider all combinations of three nodes and verify if there exist edges between every pair within the combination.\n\nThis is computationally intensive manually, but it involves a count of each set of three nodes that satisfies the triangle property. Instead, we will use a programmatic approach to systematically explore all node connections in all three-node combinations.\n\n### Programmatic Approach for Exact Counting:\nHere is how to do it logically in an algorithm:\n\n1. Pick every combination of 3 vertices (i, j, k).\n2. Check if edges exist between each pair (i, j), (i, k), and (j, k).\n3.
