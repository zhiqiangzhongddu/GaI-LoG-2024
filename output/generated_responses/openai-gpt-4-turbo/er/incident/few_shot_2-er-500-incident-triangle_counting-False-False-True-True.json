Almost every node is connected to several other nodes, creating a high possibility for multiple closed loops of three nodes (triangles) within such a structure. \n\nHowever, calculating the exact number of triangles manually in such a dense graph is intricate and usually requires systematic counting or computational help, as simply observing the image is not reliable to enumerate all combinations efficiently.\n\nThus, due to complexity and to provide an accurate answer it's necessary to utilize more detailed algorithms or methods specifically designed to find and count triangles in a graph, which could involve code or specialized software in practical applications. Hence, I cannot provide the exact number of triangles within the graph based on just the information and visual. The number of triangles in the graph is [complex to determine manually].",
