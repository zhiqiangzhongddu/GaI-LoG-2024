Thus, we'll count each edge connecting distinct pairs of nodes based on the connections described for each node:\n\n- Node 0 connects with 8 nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10).\n- Node 1 connects with 9 nodes (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) - but since node 0's connections cover some, we only add the new ones not already counted i.e., 8's and 9's.\n- Node 2 connects with (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) - similarly, connections to 0, 1 are already counted.\n- We continue this pattern removing already counted connections.\n\nNotice that each internal list explains connectivity excluding already counted pairs to ensure no double counting. As multiple nodes connect to all others, overlap in connectivity is extensive. After checking connections for all nodes, removing overlaps (connections previously counted in earlier node descriptions), the total counts become clear.\n\n**Summing these unique counts**:\n\n- Connections from Node 0: 8\n- Connections from Node 1: 2 (new nodes 8, 9 since 0-7, 10 already counted in node 0)\n- Connections from Node 2: 0 (all connections already coverted by nodes 0 and 1)\n- Connections from Node 3: 0 (all connections between 0, 1, 2 and other nodes covered)\n- Connections from Node 4: 0 (all accounted by nodes 0, 1, 2, 3)\n- Connections from Node 5: 0 (all already counted)\n- Connections from Node 6: 0 (all already counted)\n- Connections from Node 7: 0 (all already counted)\n- Connections from Node 8: 0 (all already defined with nodes 1, 2, 3, etc.)\n- Connections from Node 9: 0 (all already defined with nodes 1, 2, 3, etc.)\n- Connections from Node 10: 0 (all already encompassed by previous nodes)\n\nIf we visualize this incrementally, you'd see that node 10 doesn't introduce new edges as those connections are all previously recorded. Thus, total unique pairs constitute the edges.\n\nThe total number of edges considering mutual coordinate nodes is 36 (since each mutual connection such as 0-1 is an individual edge).\n\nTherefore, the number of edges in the graph is [36].",
