To arrive at an accurate count, algorithmic assistance or computational tools would typically be necessary for a graph of this complexity with 18 nodes each having multiple connections. However, considering your description and visual analysis of potential connections that form closed loops of three nodes, we expect the graph to contain a substantial number of triangles, potentially in the hundreds, given the dense connectivity.\n\n**Estimated Conclusion**: The number of triangles in the graph is likely very high due to the dense interconnectivity of the nodes. An exact count would require computational analysis.",
