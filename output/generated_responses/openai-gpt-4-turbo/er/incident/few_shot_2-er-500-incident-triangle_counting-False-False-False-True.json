This typically involves listing all the sets of three connected vertices. In complex graphs like the one depicted, computational methods become a necessity for accuracy and efficiency.\n\nHowever, observing the image and attempting to manually count or estimate, especially in a graph with a large number of nodes closely interconnected, is likely to yield an inaccurate result.
