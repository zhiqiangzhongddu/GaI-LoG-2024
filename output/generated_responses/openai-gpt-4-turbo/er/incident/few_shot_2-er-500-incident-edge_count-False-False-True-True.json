Since this is an undirected graph, an edge between two nodes is only counted once, so we will divide the total sum by two finally.\n\nLet's count the degree for each node:\n- Node 0: connected to 11 nodes\n- Node 1: connected to 9 nodes\n- Node 2: connected to 8 nodes\n- Node 3: connected to 11 nodes\n- Node 4: connected to 9 nodes\n- Node 5: connected to 7 nodes\n- Node 6: connected to 8 nodes\n- Node 7: connected to 10 nodes\n- Node 8: connected to 8 nodes\n- Node 9: connected to 8 nodes\n- Node 10: connected to 8 nodes\n- Node 11: connected to 9 nodes\n\nNow, sum these degrees: \n11 + 9 + 8 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 106\n\nSince each edge is accounted for twice, we need to divide by 2 to find the actual number of edges:\n106 / 2 = 53\n\nTherefore, the number of edges in the graph is [53].",
