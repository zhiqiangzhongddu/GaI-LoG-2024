Recalculation leads to each node having connections almost to every other node leading to almost complete graph connections. Given every node connects to almost every other node, and no connections being omitted from the description, it should indeed form a pattern. From the description, it looks like a simple oversight may have occurred in counting for each node, but fundamentally each node connects to almost every other. Thus, counting each connection accurately or dividing the total number of possible connections (17 * 16 / 2 = 136) by 2 might give a closer indication:\n\nHence, a more accurate count following this logic and adjusting for an error gives us a reestimated count that should reflect the complete or almost complete connectivity. Adjusting the total count for a nearly complete graph of 17 nodes (17*16/2 = 136).
