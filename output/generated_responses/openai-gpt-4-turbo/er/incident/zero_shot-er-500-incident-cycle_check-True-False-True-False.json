  "485": "To determine if there is a cycle in the graph G described, let's review the connections between the nodes:\n\n- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4.\n- Node 2 is connected to node 4.\n- Node 3 is connected to node 1.\n- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2.\n\nWe can follow the nodes and connections to see if we get back to a starting node without retracing any edge:\n\n1. Starting from Node 1, we can go to Node 3.\n2. From Node 3, the only connection goes back to Node 1.\n\nThis loop of Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 1 forms a cycle. Thus, we can conclude:\nYes, there is a cycle.",
