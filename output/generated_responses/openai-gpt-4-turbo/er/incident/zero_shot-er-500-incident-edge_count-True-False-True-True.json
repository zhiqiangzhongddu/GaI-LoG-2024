Here's the detailed breakdown of connections, noting that each node has connections to 16 out of the 17 total nodes:\n\n1. **Edge Counting:** Since there are 17 nodes, and each node is connected to 16 others, if all were unique and counted once per pair, you might think \\(17 \\times 16 = 272\\) edges are present. However, this count considers each edge twice (once from each node), since the graph is undirected.\n2. **Accounting for Undirected Edges:** To avoid double-counting, we divide the total number by 2, giving \\( \\frac{272}{2} = 136\\).\n\nThus, in this graph configuration where each node is connected to 16 others, the number of edges in the graph is **136**.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the structure of the graph, where it appears highly interconnected with few exceptions, as shown in the image. Such patterns indicate a complete graph (K_n) with one missing connection per node, leading to a nearly full connection matrix.",

A complete graph with n vertices, denoted as \\( K_n \\), has \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) edges. For 16 nodes, this would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 \\times 15}{2} = 120 \\text{ edges}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, let's check how many edges are actually removed since not all pairs are connected:\n   - Node 0 is connected to all but no exceptions. (15 connections)\n   - Node 1 is missing a connection only to node 3. (14 connections)\n   - Similarly, for each node, we need to count the connections from the description and compare it to \\( n - 1 \\) (since each node should connect to 15 others in a complete graph).\n\nAnalyzing the connections from the description, the pattern indicates each node has only 1 or 2 non-connections (meaning 13 to 14 connections per node). Let's recalculate just in case:\n\n   - Node 2: connected to 14 nodes (no exception here).\n   - Node 3: missing a connection only to node 0. (14 connections)\n   - Node 4: missing a connection only to node 10. (14 connections)\n   - Node 5: connected to all nodes except node 10 (14 connections), etc.\n\n3. However, the pattern shows closely a complete connection for all with very few exceptions. The corrections made will typically be minimal as only one connection per node is absent at average. These missing connections are typically overlapping, meaning fewer distinct edges are removed than it might initially seem. \n\nUpon carefully counting any actual edge deletions based on the exceptions and avoiding double counting the same edge, it turns out all nodes except nodes 3 and 9 have one non-connected node, and each non-connection affects very specific pairs without repeats in this context. Hence the total number of non-connections is tiny compared to a full graph.\n\nFrom the configuration observed, all nodes connect similarly with almost all others and hence any non-connection would still make the count near the complete graph count.\n\nThe number of edges in the graph is approximately close to the initial calculation of 120, but I have recalculated and realized each node has roughly 14 connections (with tiny exceptions).

Doing a manual count or checking the connections, we compute the total number of unique edges as follows:\n\nCount of unique connections in the description:\n1. Nodes connected to 0 (7 edges)\n2. Nodes connected to 1 excluding those already counted with 0 (4 edges)\n3. Nodes connected to 2 excluding those already counted with 0 or 1 (3 edges)\n4.

Node 6 connections excluding previous (3 edges)\n8. Node 7 connections excluding previous (2 edges)\n9. Node 8 connections excluding previous (2 edges)\n10. Node 9 connections excluding previous (2 edges)\n11. Node 10 connections excluding previous (2 edges)\n12. Node 11 connections excluding previous (1 edges)\n13.
