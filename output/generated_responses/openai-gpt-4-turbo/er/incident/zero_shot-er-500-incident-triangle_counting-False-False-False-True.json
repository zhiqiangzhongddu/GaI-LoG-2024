Given the high density and connectivity of the graph, as seen in the image and detailed connectivity of vertices, the graph seems to contain a large number of triangles, typically in the range of dozens depending on the exact connections.\n\nWithout computational software or a detailed mathematical approach (counting each combination), it's challenging to provide an exact count from visual inspection alone. However, an estimate can be gathered by recognizing the completeness of smaller subgraphs (complete graphs on 3 vertices within the larger graph).\n\nFor precise results, using a graph algorithm programmatically, such as enumeration of all triplets and checking if they form a cycle, is recommended.\n\nThe number of triangles in the graph is [an estimated large number, precise counting requires algorithmic approach].",
