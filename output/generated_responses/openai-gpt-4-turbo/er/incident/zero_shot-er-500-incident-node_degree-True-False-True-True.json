  "495": "The degree of node 4 in the graph is the number of edges that connect to it. In the image, there are no visible edges connected to node 4. Therefore, node 4 is an isolated node.\n\nThe degree is [0].",
  "496": "To find the degree of node 9 in the graph, we count the number of edges connected to node 9.\n\nAccording to the given graph and textual description, node 9 is connected to nodes:\n- 3\n- 5\n- 7\n- 8\n\nAdding these up, we can see that there are 4 edges connected to node 9. Therefore, the degree of node 9 is 4.\n\nThe degree is [4].",
  "497": "The degree is [0].",
  "498": "The degree of a node in an undirected graph is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nFor node 13 in the provided graph:\n- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\nCounting these connections, we have:\n- Total connections: 13\n\nTherefore, the degree of node 13 is 13. \n\n**The degree is [13].**",
  "499": "To determine the degree of node 10, we need to count all distinct edges connected to node 10. From the description of the graph and looking at the image, node 10 is connected to node 11.\n\nSince there is only one distinct node connected to node 10:\n\nThe degree is [1]."
