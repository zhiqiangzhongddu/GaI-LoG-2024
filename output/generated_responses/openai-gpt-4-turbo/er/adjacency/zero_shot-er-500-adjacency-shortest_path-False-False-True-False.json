Node 2 is directly connected to node 1, but there is no continuation towards node 9 from node 1.\n2. Therefore, consider further connections from node 2, back toward connected nodes via other paths. Node 2 isn't immediately connected to other nodes that lead directly to node 9.\n   \n**Exploratory Path Analysis**:\n- **From Node 3**: Node 3 connects to node 9 directly. Key paths are:\n  - Node 3 connects to node 4, which connects to node 6, but those don't link directly to node 9.\n  - The direct edges (3, 9) are crucial, as this creates a shorter potential path.\n  - Paths from node 3 also reach node 10, which is connected to node 9.\n\n**Finding Connections**: Node 2 lacks a direct connection leading to nodes around node 9. We need to find an intermediate series of connections.\n- Consider edges from nodes not yet examined directly related to node 2. Node 4 is connected to node 3 (and subsequently node 4 to node 6), making node 3 a potential middleman.\n- The most important connection via node 3 is observed, considering its direct link to both node 8 and node 9.\n\n**Constructing the Path**:\n1. Start at node 2, travel to node 1.\n2. From node 1, there are still no direct links to our target areas (no edges defined).\n   \nSince direct paths are not observable for nodes expanding directly from node 2 to node 9, we explore node connections generically:\n- **Examine other nodes**:\n  - Node 8 connects to node 0, node 7, and node 3.\n  - Thus, through node 8, you can reach node 3.\n  - From Node 3, as known, there is a direct connection to node 9 via (3, 9).\n\n**Seeking the Shortest Path**:\n- The best route from node 2 would be via any possible connections that link to node 3 and from there directly to node 9.\n- No direct connection from node 2 to node 3, 8, or any node directly linking to node 9 is observable. Additional node data (spanning beyond nodes connected to 1, as it contributes no further path) would potentially provide intermediate nodes. Missing edges suggest incomplete path information based on the provided edges.\n\nConclusion:\n- The shortest path available and depicted from node 2 to node 9, using the connections to node 3 (via node 8 if possible) and then directly from node 3 to node 9: involves at least a 2-node hop (if node 2 connects to node 3 indirectly through an unknown intermediate). \n\nSince an exact link from node 2 to node 3 or node 2 to a node connecting to node 3 is not directly stated, and no further elaboration on intermediate nodes is accessible, we assume a minimum path length based on possible inferred connections.\n\n**Final Answer**: The length of the shortest path is [3 when incurring an indirect linkage from 3 to adjacent nodes extended from node 2 (e.g., node 2 to an intermediate node to node 3 to node 9)].",
  "487": "To find the length of the shortest path between node 13 and node 0, let's analyze possible connections using the edges provided:\n\n1. Starting from node 13, and considering its direct connections:\n   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 directly.\n\n2. Now let's examine if any of these directly connected nodes have an immediate connection to node 0:\n   - Node 1 is not directly connected to node 0.\n   - Node 4 is not directly connected to node 0.\n   - Node 6 is directly connected to node 0. \n   - Node 8 is not directly connected to node 0.\n   - Node 10 is not directly connected to node 0.\n\n3. The path between nodes 13 to 6 to 0 is valid:\n   - From node 13 to node 6 (one hop).\n   - From node 6 to node 0 (another hop).\n   \nTherefore, this path (13 -> 6 -> 0) is 2 edges long.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe length of the shortest path is 2.",
