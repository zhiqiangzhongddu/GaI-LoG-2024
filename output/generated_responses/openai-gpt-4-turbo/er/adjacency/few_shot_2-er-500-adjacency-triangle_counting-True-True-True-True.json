We typically use algorithmic support or specific enumeration strategies that I can't perform as easily in this interface. However, considering the information provided about the dense and almost complete subgraph on nodes, we can hypothesize that the graph is heavily interconnected, likely resulting in a vast number of triangles. \n\nTo provide a meaningful estimate without exact calculation capability here, the graph described and the level of interconnection suggested implies that the number of triangles is very high. For practical purposes in this scenario, stating that the graph is densely populated with triangles such that the number can range in the hundreds or thousands depending on the exact connections between the less frequently mentioned nodes. \n\nThe number of triangles in the graph is likely several hundreds or more, but precise calculation would require computational verification.",
