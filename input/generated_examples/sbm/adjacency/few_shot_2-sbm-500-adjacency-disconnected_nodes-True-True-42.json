G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 17) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 17) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 12) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (7, 12) (7, 15) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 17) (13, 14).\nLet's construct the graph with the nodes and edges first.\nQ: List all the nodes that are not connected to 3 in alphabetical order.\nA: ",
