G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 15) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 15) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 15) (2, 17) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 18) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 15) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 16) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 18) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 16) (11, 17) (11, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (13, 14) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 18) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 18) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 17) (16, 18).\nQ: What is the length of the shortest path from node 16 to node 18?\nA: 1. Because, there is an edge from node 16 to node 18 .\nExample: In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge. G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 17) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 17) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 12) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (9, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (7, 12) (7, 15) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 17) (13, 14).\nQ: What is the length of the shortest path from node 1 to node 14?\nA: ",
