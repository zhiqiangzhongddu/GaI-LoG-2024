G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5).\nLet's construct the graph with the nodes and edges first.\nQ: What is the degree of node 5?\nA: 3. This is because 5 is connected to 0, 1, and 4.\nExample: In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
