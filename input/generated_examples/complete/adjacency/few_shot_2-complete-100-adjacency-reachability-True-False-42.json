G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 9).\nQ: Is there a path from node 3 to node 9?\nA: ",
