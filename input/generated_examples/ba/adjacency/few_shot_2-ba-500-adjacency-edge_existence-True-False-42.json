G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (8, 9).\nQ: Is node 2 connected to node 4?\nA: No. Because, there is no edge from 2 to 4 in the graph description.\nExample: In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge. G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 14) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (2, 14) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 13) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 14) (8, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 14) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 14).\nQ: Is node 3 connected to node 0?\nA: ",
